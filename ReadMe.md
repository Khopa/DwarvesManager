*Description :*

Dwarves Manager is a game about managing a dwarven diamond mine in a fantasy world. 
You have to recruit different dwarves, organize their workplace, and define areas to be mined.
The goal of the game is to gather all the diamonds in every level, but it won't be easy ! Your dwarves will need to drink at the tavern, and rest in their dorm before going to work. You'll also need to hire craftsmen to make pickaxes for your miners. Then maybe, you'll be able to gather the precious stones, but beware of bankruptcy as you have to pay your employees' wages everyday.

*Notes :* 

- This use a rather old version of LibGDX (Prior to 1.0 release)
- Never tried to compile iOS version (Don't have the hardware)
- HTML5 GWT project will probably not work, since the project use GWT-unsupported functionnalities
